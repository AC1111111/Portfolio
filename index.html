    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>

    <p>
        I'm currently a 3rd year student of Computer Science and Engineering at Chitkara University, Punjab. Passionate about Technical 
        artistry (video games to be precise) and just love tinkering with different creation tools and frameworks. 
    </p>

    <h2><u>Education</u></h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Passed Class 12 at St. Mary's School, Patiala</li>
            <li>Will get a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at Chitkara University in 2024</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2><u>Skills</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Unreal Engine</li>
        <li>SonicPi</li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>Adobe Premiere Pro</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Projects</u></h2>
    <h3>Endless Runner Game</h3>
    <img src="Course Full.png" alt="A Picture from the project" class="Image">
    <p>
        I made an Endless Runner game in Unreal Engine 4 for a school project. The game used a combination of C++ and Unreal's Blueprint
        Visual Scripting system.
    </p>

    <h3>Remotely Controlled Polysynth</h3>
    <p>
        I also made a polysynth that ran on a Raspberry Pi and could be controlled via an Android app using a USB cable. The polysynth was
        created in SonicPi using Ruby and used the Android device as a MIDI keyboard. Although, the app was far from finished, it provided
        a solid demonstration of the things that can be done witht this idea.
    </p>

    <h3>An Automatic Mood Light</h3>
    <p>
        I also created a Mood Light that ran on an Arduino Uno using C++. The light would change brightness automatically based on the time of day. 
    </p>

    <h3>Line following, proximity robot</h3>
    <p>
        Me and a team of 2 other people created a Robot for a university project that would follow and object along a line. This was done 
        using an Arduino Uno, an Ultrasonic Sensor, 2 IR sensors and other miscellaneous components. The project was coded by me in C++.  
    </p>

    <h3>Video Editing</h3>

    <p>
        I also got into video editing using Adobe Premiere Pro and have, over the years, put some of my better videos on a 
        YouTube channel.
